Wreckless Endangerment
This game idea came from the inspiration of my very own driving habits. The game is meant to emulate 
the expirience of flying down the highway as if you are late to your high level tech job on the day of 
an important meeting or perhaps you just enjoy the thrill of Wreckless Endangerment!

Controls:
Use left and right arrow keys to move your yellow car into empty lanes to avoid the approaching traffic

Bugs or unfinished game elements:
The ability of enemy cars to leave you without any escape route causing a forced loss. This was remedied 
by not allowing enemy cars on the same line as the User. Not the most advance fix but keeps the old arcade 
game vibe and feel.

Sprite Citation:
User and Enemy cars both cam from "https://chiffaprodaction.itch.io/pixel-cars"
